# Jitsi Meetings with Alfred 

With this workflow you can create and schedule Jitsi meetings with Alfred on Mac. 

### Create Meeting Link

This creates a random meeting link and copies it to the clipboard for further use.

### Schedule Meeting

This one creates a random meeting link and creates a new event in Fantastical with this meeting link attached. 


# Notes

Feel free to modify this to use another calendar application than Fantastical. It should be no problem to modify the workflow so that it can use the builtin Apple Calendar. If I can find some time, I'll adjust this - but any help from the community is very appreciated - please let me know.
